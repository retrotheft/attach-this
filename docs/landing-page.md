# Landing Page

Features should be pull out tabs hiding behind the code viewer.
Code viewer starts with instructions: Pull out feature tab to begin!
Use Intersection Observer to detect when a tab has been fully removed.
Upon activation, all children of the feature tab are revealed. Transition size.
Need to ensure movable tabs don't affect positions of others until fully removed.


Code viewer should have an OL for line numbers. Code needs to be arrays. Could automate this.


## Movable

Just an element that can move

## Hoverable

Nested elements

## Filter

Use the code box, filter by line

## Replace

Create a way to make key/value replacement pairs
Drag elements into the replace box and see them auto replace
Allow the user to drag anything on the page into this box, including the code

## Descriptions

For each demo, write a quick description?
